                <h2>Our Hero</h2>
                <p class = "text">Despite the fact that there are a lot of brave men around the kingdom of
                    Colchis, each one with its own brave actions, we believe that Prince
                    Pantufa is the biggest hero of them all. Providing comfort to every child,
                    woman and man across the realm is in his job description. </p>
                <p class="text">There is no way anybody can pet him or hold him without getting attacked by his mighty
                    claws, however, he provides all the good feelings that people need by just
                    existing and allowing them to look at him and his beauty while he rests on
                    his royal pillow. He's a royal cat after all, what did you expect? That he
                    would allow every and any peasant around him to stain his magnificent fur?
                    No way! Despite him not being the most active of heroes nobody else can
                    say that they helped through times of war, sickness, hunger, poverty or
                    sadness while they slept! All hail prince Pantufa!</p>
